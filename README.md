# Website Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website. You can check it out here [https://pnhalim.github.io/](https://pnhalim.github.io/).

I developed this with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS. I also used some additional tools like locomotive scroll to get the effects I was going for. Some other tools I used were Figma, npm, and parcel.
